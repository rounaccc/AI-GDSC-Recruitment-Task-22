## Question 1

Implement a function StringManipulation(str), that accepts a string as the str parameter and performs the following operations on it:

- very letter in the string should be changed to its succeeding alphabet (ie., c becomes d, z becomes a). Numbers are left unchanged. (Hint: lists can be used)
- The string is inverted after removing all vowels. (Reminder: Don’t alter the alphabets’ case)
- The string has every alternate character from the original string (e.g. for an input “abcdefg”, the output string would be “aceg”)
Print every output separately and label them appropriately. You must use python to solve this question.
